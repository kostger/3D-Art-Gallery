  AMOR: "Amor, known as Cupid in Roman mythology and Eros in Greek mythology, is the god of love and desire. Often depicted as a playful, winged child carrying a bow and arrows, he wields the power to ignite passion and affection by striking the hearts of gods and mortals alike. In myths, Amor is both mischievous and deeply symbolic, representing the unpredictable and transformative nature of love. While he sometimes acts impulsively, his role in the story of Amor und Psyche reveals his depth, as he defies his mother Venus's will to protect and unite with Psyche, showing that even love's god can experience vulnerability and devotion.",

            Venus's son, though their union is tested by secrecy and challenges

            the triumph of perseverance, and the harmony between human emotions
            and divine forces.`,
