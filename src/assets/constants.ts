  HERCULES: `Hercules, known as Heracles in Greek mythology, is a demigod celebrated for his extraordinary strength and heroic deeds. The son of Zeus and the mortal Alcmene, he is famed for his Twelve Labors, which include slaying the Nemean Lion and capturing the Erymanthian Boar. Despite his immense power, Hercules' life was fraught with challenges, including conflicts with the goddess Hera and personal tragedies. Ultimately, he achieved immortality and ascended to Olympus, embodying resilience and the human quest for redemption.`,

  ARCHELOUS: `Achelous, the ancient Greek river god, symbolizes the untamed forces of water and nature. Known for his ability to shapeshift, he often took on the form of a bull or serpent in mythology. One of his most famous tales involves his battle with Hercules for the hand of Deianira. Despite his transformations, Achelous was defeated when Hercules broke off one of his horns, which was later turned into the cornucopia, a symbol of abundance and prosperity.`,

  STORY_1: `Hercules, the demigod famed for his strength and valor, stood by the banks of the river Achelous, preparing to face the river god Archelous for the hand of the beautiful Deianira. Archelous, determined to prove his superiority, mocked Hercules, claiming that his divine powers far outweighed the hero's brute strength. In his arrogance, the river god transformed himself into a colossal serpent, his shimmering scales reflecting the sunlight as his body coiled menacingly around the hero. Hercules, undaunted by the transformation, gripped his mighty club tightly and prepared to confront this new form of his foe.`,
  STORY_2: `Archelous, in his serpentine form, lunged at Hercules with lightning speed, fangs bared to strike. The demigod leaped aside, dodging the venomous bite, and countered with a powerful blow of his club. The clash shook the ground as the serpent lashed out with its massive tail, attempting to ensnare Hercules in its coils. The hero, using his legendary strength, wrestled with the serpent, his hands gripping its slippery scales as he evaded its crushing grip. Despite its immense size and speed, the serpent could not match Hercules' determination, and soon its once-confident strikes grew sluggish and desperate.`,
  STORY_3: `Summoning all his strength, Hercules seized the serpent by its neck, squeezing with an iron grip that no mortal could withstand. The river god writhed and thrashed, but even in his divine form, he was no match for the son of Zeus. With a final, earth-shaking effort, Hercules hurled the defeated serpent to the ground. Archelous, humbled and exhausted, reverted to his true form and conceded defeat, granting Hercules the right to wed Deianira. The hero stood triumphant by the river's edge, a testament to the power of courage and determination against even the mightiest of adversaries.`,
