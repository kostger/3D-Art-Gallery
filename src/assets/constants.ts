  AMOR: "Amor, known as Cupid in Roman mythology and Eros in Greek mythology, is the god of love and desire. Often depicted as a playful, winged child carrying a bow and arrows, he wields the power to ignite passion and affection by striking the hearts of gods and mortals alike. In myths, Amor is both mischievous and deeply symbolic, representing the unpredictable and transformative nature of love. While he sometimes acts impulsively, his role in the story of Amor und Psyche reveals his depth, as he defies his mother Venus's will to protect and unite with Psyche, showing that even love's god can experience vulnerability and devotion.",
  UND: `*"Amor und Psyche" is a timeless myth of love
            and trust, originally found in Metamorphoses by the Roman author
            Apuleius. The story narrates the trials of Psyche, a mortal woman
            whose beauty rivals that of Venus, earning the goddess's wrath.

            Venus's son, though their union is tested by secrecy and challenges
            imposed by the gods. It symbolizes the transformative power of love,
            the triumph of perseverance, and the harmony between human emotions
            and divine forces.`,
  PSYCHE: `Psyche, whose name means "soul" in Greek, is a mortal woman of extraordinary beauty who becomes the central figure in the myth of Amor und Psyche. Her beauty draws the envy of Venus and leads to a series of divine trials that test her courage, determination, and faith.

Her enduring love for Amor and her willingness to face hardships for their union reflect the profound connection between love and the human spirit. Psyche ultimately achieves immortality, signifying the eternal nature of true love and the soul's ascension.`,
